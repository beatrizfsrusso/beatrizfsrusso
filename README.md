## Hi there 👋

Welcome 👋

## About me

Computer Science student at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar). Actively engaged in extracurricular tech activities such as robotics, competitive programming, and data science. Member of the robotics team Red Dragons, where I develop autonomous soccer robots using Python, and participant in programming groups like M@U and Panda.

Worked as a frontend developer at Cati Jr., building real-world applications using React, TypeScript, and JavaScript. Experience in data analysis using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), automation scripts, and project-based learning.

Certified in Linux and system administration by RedHat (RH124, RH104). Passionate about creating useful systems, solving algorithmic problems, and exploring AI applications in robotics and software.

Always curious and eager to learn more — especially in the areas of software engineering, automation, and applied AI.
